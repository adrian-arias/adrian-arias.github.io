         <h2 class="Titles">About</h2>
         <p>I am born and raised in Idaho. I've lived in Wilder all my life and attended school<br> 
            there. I graduated at Wilder High School in 2019 and starting attending<br>
            College of Western Idaho. I plan finishing CWI and transfer to a University.<br>
             
         </p>
         <h2 class="Titles">Coding Experience</h2>
         <p>I've always had an interest in coding. I never worked with coding outside<br>
            of school. I'm now learning different code languages in school. Now I'm eager<br>
            to learn more and make it my career.</p>
         <h2 class="Titles">Interest</h2>
         <p>My interests are anything that have to do with technology. I like to <br>
            learn more about the lastest technologies. Whether its the lastest phones<br>
            or the lastest graphics card for a computer. Sometimes I would always like to watch<br>
            videos of people showing the newest tech. Over the years I slowly started<br>
            working and learning with computers. Especially during my high school years<br>
            where I would always work with 3D printers.</p>
         <h2 class="Titles">Hobbies</h2>
         <p>My biggest hobbie is gaming. I've been playing all types of games for 90%<br>
            of my life. I mostly play on console but I've slowly been transitioning<br>
            to PC. I also want to get back into 3D printing and get better at designing<br>
            models for it.</p>
